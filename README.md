# Practical-Machine-Learning-
Final programming assignement
## Project summary:
The goal of this project is using the data from the study "Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises"" Proceedings of 4th International Conference in Cooperation with SIGCHI to “predict the manner in which they did the exercise.” The report should describe:
* “how you built your model”
* “how you used cross validation”
* “what you think the expected out of sample error is”
* “why you made the choices you did”
For this assignement I used for prediction 2 algorithms to build my model,namely random forest and decission trees. 
Random Forests gave an Accuracy in the myTesting dataset of 99.89%, which was more accurate that Decision Tree analysis. The expected out-of-sample error is 100-99.89 = 0.11%.
